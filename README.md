### Huge WIP

Still learning Nix and NixOS myself but my goal is to eventually make this modular and easy to recreate on any system.

#### General Info
- OS: NixOS
- DE: no desktop environment
- WM: Hyprland (wayland) / i3 (xorg)
- Bar: Waybar, soon will change to custom Fabric-py bar

#### Notes
- The config is currently done using only `configuration.nix` and home-manager, but I am planning to switch to flakes soon.
